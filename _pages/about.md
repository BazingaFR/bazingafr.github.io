I’m an advanced data analytics, reporting and visualisation professional with a demonstrated history of leading and delivering analytics and insights solutions to clients in a variety of industries.
Trusted advisor to senior marketers, technology and finance leaders, I help clients translate highly complex data and analytical concepts into strategically-aligned, commercially-oriented outputs.
I’ve got full end-to-end big data analytics experience with practical know-how on structured and unstructured data management, exploratory analysis, predictive analytics and data storytelling.
I’m also an analytics instructor, a blogger on data science and statistical computing techniques and an M.Phil. research candidate at The University of Sydney in Learning Analytics.

Hi there, I'm Felipe. I'm a data scientist and visualisation consultant. I help companies from a variety of industries and sizes acquire, manage and translate highly complex data and analytical concepts into strategically-aligned, commercially-oriented, customer-centred solutions.

When I'm not helping clients, I'm an analytics instructor helping disseminate practical, actionable analytics and data visualisation techniques.

When I'm not helping clients or students, I'm an M.Phil. research candidate in Learning Analytics at the University of Sydney making sense of digital traces of students and the role learning analytics dashboards for self-assessment play in influencing learning outcomes. 

I'm also a blogger in predictive analytics, statistical learning and data visualisation, a husband and a father of two.

Success Stories

##### As Analyst
*“Felipe was my predecessor of my previous analytical role at DSE. [...] I see him as a great mentor. I have learned more from reading through his old files than I would have ever done by myself. From creating business models to writing commentaries, from coding efficient SQLs to designing graphs and charts, I have grown so much in analytics and market research just via “stealing” from Felipe’s old works. Thank you very much, Felipe, I am absolutely grateful for the legacy you left to the company and to me.”*

History

On 20 August 1945, the Indonesian government established the Agency for Assisting Families of War Victims (Badan Penolong Keluarga Korban Perang; abbreviated as BPKKP) and its focus was to assist the war victims and their respective family during the time of Indonesian National Revolution.

In 1966, the government established the Advisory Board of Central Natural Disaster Management (Badan Pertimbangan Penanggulangan Bencana Alam Pusat; abbreviated as BP2BA) through the Presidential Decree Number 256 of 1966. The board was responsible to the Minister of Social Affairs. A year later, the Cabinet Presidium through Decree number 14/U/KEP/I/1967, established the National Coordination Team for Disaster Management (Tim Koordinasi Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana Alam; abbreviated as TKP2BA).

Bakornas PB was established in 1979 to replace the Advisory Board for Natural Disaster, which was established in 1966.

Amongst other things, the Board issues regular information about the status of alerts for selected Indonesian volcanoes. In issuing these information bulletins, the Board draws on the advice of the Centre for Volcanology and Disaster Hazard Mitigation (often known as PVMBG from the Indonesian name for the Centre, Pusat Vulkanology dan Mitigasi Bencana Geologi). These bulletins are intended to warn local residents of likely threats and also help in planning for emergency response activities. The alerts are also useful for visitors who may be planning trips to these sites. As of September 2011, five volcanoes were included on the Level III "Alert" (Indonesian: Siaga) list and 12 were on the Level II "Vigilant" (Indonesian: Waspada) list[2] The list of volcanoes for which warnings were outstanding as at September 2011 included the following:

Level III: Alert status

    Mt Lokon, Sulawesi
    Mt Ibu, Halmahera Island
    Mt Karangetang to the north of Sulawesi
    Mt Papandayan in West Java
    Mt Soputan in Sulawesi

Level II: Vigilant status

The well-known tourist site of Mount Bromo remained under review having been placed on the lower Level II "Vigilant" list as of 13 June 2011. Late in 2010 the Mt Bromo region had been placed on the highest Level IV "Warning" (Indonesian: Awas) but was later downgraded to Level III.[3]

A useful National Disaster Plan for Indonesia 2010-2014 is available at the BNPB website.

The Board has noted that financial support for disaster responses in Indonesia remains relatively limited. A spokesperson for the board observed that a sum of only Rp 4 trillion (around $US 470 million) had been allocated to support disaster relief in Indonesia during 2011.[4][1]

introduction: |
  Hi there, I'm Felipe. I'm an [advanced analytics and data visualisation consultant](https://feliperego.github.io/about). I help teams improve their organisations performance through the use of data and analytics:

  - I help organisations improve revenue performance by exploring how products are sold, services are consumed and customers shop.
  - I partner with marketing and retention teams to identify which customers are at risk of leaving way before they do.
  - I support strategy teams in identifying which combination of products and services make the most sense for their organisations.
  - I build data and reporting solutions for finance teams to allow for better operations monitoring and performance improvement.

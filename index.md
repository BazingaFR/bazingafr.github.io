introduction: |
  Felipe is an [advanced analytics and data visualisation consultant](https://feliperego.github.io/about) helping organisations improve performance through data and analytics:

  Organisations seek my services when they need help with:

  - Finding extra revenue from existing customers by exploring how products are sold, services are consumed and customers shop.
  - Identifying  which customers are at risk of leaving many days before they do.
  - Optimising the combination of products and services that make the most sense to their business.
  - Monitoring of sales,campaign and operational activities.

  I'm available to consult, advise and/or develop advanced data analytics and visualisation solutions with marketing, digital, sales, operations, finance, technology and strategy teams across Australia.

introduction: |
  Hi there, I'm Felipe. I'm an [advanced analytics and data visualisation consultant](https://feliperego.github.io/about). As an independent data science partner, I help teams improve their organisations performance through the use of data and analytics:

  - I help organisations improve revenue performance by exploring how products are sold, services are consumed and customers shop.
  - I partner with marketing and retention teams to identify which customers are at risk of leaving way before they do.
  - I support strategy teams in identifying which combination of products and services make the most sense for their organisations.
  - I build data and reporting solutions for finance teams to allow for better operations monitoring and performance improvement.

  I'm also an [analytics instructor](https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/felipe-rego/7721) helping disseminate practical, actionable analytics and data visualisation techniques in both classrooms and online settings.

  When I'm not partnering with clients or helping students, I'm an [M.Phil. research candidate](http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/people/felipe.carbonerego.830.php) in Learning Analytics at the University of Sydney making sense of students' digital traces and the role learning analytics dashboards play in influencing learning outcomes.

  I'm also a [blogger](https://feliperego.github.io/blog) in predictive analytics, statistical learning and data visualisation, a husband and a father of two.

  I'm available to consult, advise and/or develop advanced data analytics and visualisation solutions with marketing, digital, sales, operations, finance, technology and strategy teams across Australia.

*“I had the pleasure of working with Felipe for almost two years. His skill set and attention to detail was second to none, hence why I would leverage his abilities on a regular basis to support my sales role. Without Felipe’s help and support I feel that I would not have been as successful and with this in mind I would recommend him to any company as he would be a valuable asset.”*

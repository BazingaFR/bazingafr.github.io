	<h3>Data Visualisation &amp; Storytelling</h3>
	<div class="box">
		<p><span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic099.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span><i>"The art of storytelling is in allowing your audience to join the teller for the entire journey; to use language in such a way that meaning and movement are conveyed so the listener is part of the unfolding story. In any data-heavy business, it is rare to come come across a master of data storytelling who can convey what the data is saying, and not just what it is showing up in the numbers. In my work with Felipe he approached the problem we were trying to solve in a calm and collected manner, asking the right questions to understand what we wanted to know, which wasn't necessarily what we thought we needed. Even with an overflowing plate of work on his hands he was able to develop a framework and execute a connected 'live' platform that delivered the insights we needed. In addition he provided my team at [...] (and my [...] team) an overview of data visualization that gave us a core understanding of the 'why' of data storytelling. Felipe is a consummate professional in the data science space, a great team member and all around good guy. I highly recommend Felipe if you want someone who can grow and mold with the flow of your business and tell the right data story to anyone in your organization."</i><h4>-Client, Jul. 2017</h4></p>

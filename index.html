<p>Hi there, I'm Felipe. I'm an advanced analytics and data visualisation consultant. I help teams build, manage and enhance their data science and visualisation solutions in a strategically-aligned, commercially-oriented and customer-centred way.</p>

<h2>Strategy Alignment</h2>
<p>Teams need help in delivering tactical analytics projects within a relatively short time frame. Th may need a resource to My differential lies in partnering with those teams to not only deliver the reqired solution but and the wider organisation to help develop and/or execute on a broad analytics strategy. </p>

<p>My work focuses on helping marketing, sales, finance, technology and strategy teams with deliverying robust data-driven business insights that are easy to use, easy to undestand and, most importantly, actionable. While I excel in managing analytical projects end-to-end and nurturing high-performing analytical teams, I am also technically engaged in implementing analytical solutions. From performing robust exploratory analyses of customer behavior, to developing predictive models around customer churn and next best offers as well as highly interactive dashboard visualisations about customer or product performance.</p>

<h2>Involment with wider analytical community</h2>
<p>When I'm not consulting with clients, I'm an analytics instructor helping disseminate practical, actionable analytics and data visualisation techniques in both classrooms and online settings.</p>

<p>When I'm not partnering with clients or helping students, I'm an M.Phil. research candidate in Learning Analytics at the University of Sydney making sense of students' digital traces and the role learning analytics dashboards play in influencing learning outcomes.</p>

<p>I'm also a blogger in predictive analytics, statistical learning and data visualisation, a husband and a father of two.</p>

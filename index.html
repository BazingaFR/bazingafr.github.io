<p>Hi there, I'm Felipe. I'm an advanced analytics and data visualisation consultant. I help teams build, manage and enhance their data science and visualisation solutions in a strategically-aligned, commercially-oriented and customer-centred way.</p>

<p>When I'm not consulting with clients, I'm an analytics instructor helping disseminate practical, actionable analytics and data visualisation techniques in both classrooms and online settings.</p>

<p>When I'm not partnering with clients or helping students, I'm an M.Phil. research candidate in Learning Analytics at the University of Sydney making sense of students' digital traces and the role learning analytics dashboards play in influencing learning outcomes.</p>

<p>I'm also a blogger in predictive analytics, statistical learning and data visualisation, a husband and a father of two.</p>

<h2>You can hire me</h2>

<p>I'm available for hire to consult, advise and/or develop advanced data analytics and visualisation solutions with marketing, sales, finance, technology and strategy teams across Australia.<p>

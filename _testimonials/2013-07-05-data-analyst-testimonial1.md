*“Felipe was my predecessor of my previous analytical role at [...]. I have never met him because he had already left [...] for [...] one month before I joined. However, I see him as a great mentor. I have learned more from reading through his old files than I would have ever done by myself. From creating business models to writing commentaries, from coding efficient SQLs to designing graphs and charts, I have grown so much in analytics and market research just via “stealing” from Felipe’s old works. Thank you very much, Felipe, I am absolutely grateful for the legacy you left to the company and to me.”*

My work focuses on helping marketing, sales, finance, technology and strategy teams with deliverying robust data-driven business insights that are easy to use, easy to undestand and, most importantly, actionable.

While I excel in managing analytical projects end-to-end and nurturing high-performing analytical teams, I am also technically engaged in implementing analytical solutions. From performing robust exploratory analyses of customer behavior, to developing predictive models around customer churn and next best offers as well as highly interactive dashboard visualisations about customer or product performance.

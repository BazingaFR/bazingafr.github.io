As a data science partner, companies leverage my skills to help their teams build, manage and enhance their data science and visualisation solutions in a strategically-aligned, commercially-oriented and customer-centred way.

With an extensive and varied industry experience as well as a deep, practical technical expertise, I am often required by marketing, sales, finance, technology and strategy teams to provide support and delivery of analytics-driven business insights that are easy to use, easy to undestand and actionable.

"Felipe brought in my team to stand up a novel, unprecedented financial reporting capability for the business in just over a month. Expectations were high with a lot of moving parts requiring a lot of faith and a lot of communication with diverse stakeholders across the country, and Felipe brought everyone along the journey. His ability to listen, lead, learn and explain were instrumental to the project's success. I highly recommend him to anyone considering such an effort and hoping for a similar result or better."

While I excel in managing analytical projects end-to-end and nurturing high-performing analytical teams, I am also technically engaged in implementing analytical solutions. From performing robust exploratory analyses of customer behavior, to developing predictive models around customer churn and next best offers as well as highly interactive dashboard visualisations about customer or product performance.

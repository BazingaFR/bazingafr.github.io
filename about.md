As a data science partner, companies leverage my skills to help their teams build, manage and enhance their data science and visualisation solutions in a strategically-aligned, commercially-oriented and customer-centred way.

With an extensive and varied industry experience as well as a deep, practical technical expertise, I am often required by marketing, sales, finance, technology and strategy teams to provide support and delivery of analytics-driven business insights that are easy to use, easy to undestand and actionable.

While I excel in managing analytical projects end-to-end and nurturing high-performing analytical teams, I am also technically engaged in implementing analytical solutions. From performing robust exploratory analyses of customer behavior, to developing predictive models around customer churn and next best offers as well as highly interactive dashboard visualisations about customer or product performance.

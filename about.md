As a data science partner, organisations leverage my skills to help teams build, manage and enhance their data science and visualisation solutions in a strategically-aligned, commercially-oriented and customer-centred way.

With an extensive and varied industry experience as well as a deep, practical technical expertise, I am often required by marketing, sales, finance, technology and strategy teams to provide support and to deliver analytics-driven business insights that are easy to use, undestand and implement.


I specialise in providing:

### Data Discovery & Exploratory Data Analysis ###  
- I partner with teams to help them identify sources, types and quality of the data available in their organsations. From a pre-defined set of specific business questions, assumptions or hypothesis needing attention, I provide robust exploratory data analyses to help identify patterns and provide initial insights. 

### Interactive Data Visualisation Dashboards ###    
- I partner with teams to provide them with automated, interactive data visualisation dashboards about their customers, products or services performance.

### Predictive Analytics ###    
- I partner with teams to create and implement segmentation models, sales forecast, propensity to churn, recommender systems and many other analytical solutions to their day-to-day problems. 

### Analytics Project Management###
- Organisations often rely on my experience to help them lead their analytics journey to the next level.


# Success stories:

"Felipe brought in my team to stand up a novel, unprecedented financial reporting capability for the business in just over a month. Expectations were high with a lot of moving parts requiring a lot of faith and a lot of communication with diverse stakeholders across the country, and Felipe brought everyone along the journey. His ability to listen, lead, learn and explain were instrumental to the project's success. I highly recommend him to anyone considering such an effort and hoping for a similar result or better."

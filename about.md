As a data science partner, organisations leverage my skills to help teams build, manage and enhance their data science and visualisation solutions in a strategically-aligned, commercially-oriented and customer-centred way.

With an extensive and varied industry experience as well as a deep, practical technical expertise, I am often required by marketing, sales, finance, technology and strategy teams to provide support and to deliver analytics-driven business insights that are easy to use, undestand and implement.


I specialise in providing:

### Exploratory Data Analysis ###    
- Starts by identifying sources, types and quality of data available in the organsation. From a specific set of business problems, a robust exploratory data analysis is conducted to identify patterns and provide initial insights. 

### Interactive Data Visualisation Dashboards ###    
- Starts by having a clear objective and provides a visual way for teams to gauge their customers, products and services' performance.

### Predictive Analytics ###    
- Customer segmentation, sales forecasting, credit risk, customer attrition or churn rate, recommender systems, 

### Analytics Project Management###
- 


Way too often organisations are not set up in a way that allows teams to know or fully understand the extent of the data they have available about their customers, products, services and systems. From discovering new sources of information to ingesting competitor data into internal databases to tackling data quality in CRM systems, companies of all sizes require constant, robust data exploration. Occasionally, organisations don't have an in-house team that can help them with the necessary data exploration and insights needed. That is when teams can leverage my skills in ingesting, wrangling, cleaning, standardizing and querying large amounts of both structured and unstructured datasets that may exist in their businesses or outside (cloud, APIs, third-party systems, etc.) for pattern discovery and and improved business intelligence.




Marketing, sales or operations teams spend an awful lot of time planning their activities and are constantly under pressure to make their customers happy, the performance of their products optimal and the quality of their services unique. More often than not though, these teams will have little to no time or experience in gathering the often sparse and unstructured data available on their programs of work to rapidly create meaningful, actionable insights to help them adjust tactics and replan. That is when teams can leverage my skills to help them gain insights from interactive data visualisation platforms.

# Some of my success stories:


*```
"Felipe brought in my team to stand up a novel, unprecedented financial reporting capability for the business in just over a month. Expectations were high with a lot of moving parts requiring a lot of faith and a lot of communication with diverse stakeholders across the country, and Felipe brought everyone along the journey. His ability to listen, lead, learn and explain were instrumental to the project's success. I highly recommend him to anyone considering such an effort and hoping for a similar result or better."

As a data science partner, companies leverage my skills to help their teams build, manage and enhance their data science and visualisation solutions in a strategically-aligned, commercially-oriented and customer-centred way.

With an extensive and varied industry experience as well as a deep, practical technical expertise, I am often required by marketing, sales, finance, technology and strategy teams to provide support and delivery of analytics-driven business insights that are easy to use, easy to undestand and actionable.


### Interactive Dashboards for Business Insights###
Marketing, sales or operations teams spend an awful lot of time planning their activities and are constantly under pressure to make their customers happy, the performance of their products optimal and the quality of their services unique. More often than not though, these teams will have little to no time or experience in gathering the often sparse and unstructured data available on their programs of work to create meaningful, actionable insights to help them adjust tactics and react swiftly.


See what some of my clients and partner have said about my work:

***Leading a reporting solutions project for a corporate finance team***

***

*```
"Felipe brought in my team to stand up a novel, unprecedented financial reporting capability for the business in just over a month. Expectations were high with a lot of moving parts requiring a lot of faith and a lot of communication with diverse stakeholders across the country, and Felipe brought everyone along the journey. His ability to listen, lead, learn and explain were instrumental to the project's success. I highly recommend him to anyone considering such an effort and hoping for a similar result or better."

### Situation
- Contact centres for a large media organisation.
- Depended on multiple spreadsheets for measuring operational and sales performance.

### Problem
- No visibility on either individual sales agents or team for benchmarking. 
- Inability to correct behaviours and/or provide data-driven coaching.

### Solution / Tools used
- Capture business requirements. Meeting all key stakeholders to capture requirements.
- Tableau as the chosen dashboard solution (ability to scale + ease of use).
- Live connection from data warehouse (multiple SQL queries + connections).
- Highly interactive solution tailored to both team and individual views.

### Results
- A simple-to-use yet complex-to-build data visualization dashboard in Tableau was delivered on time.
- Uptake was favourable and above expectations (~80%+ active users after 3 months of implementation).
